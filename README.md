Task 01: To visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable
Welcome to Task 01 of my project! The primary aim is to offer insightful visualizations that illuminate sales trends and customer preferences within the mobile industry.

Visualizations Created:

Horizontal Bar Chart:

This visualization provides a succinct overview of the sales performance across different mobile brands. 
Each bar represents the sales volume, facilitating easy comparison between brands.

Histogram for Rating Distribution:

To discern the distribution of ratings given to mobile devices, I've crafted a histogram.
This visualization offers insights into the pattern of ratings distribution, aiding in understanding customer satisfaction levels.

Bar Plot for Rating Distribution Across Brands:

Delving deeper, I've developed a bar plot to illustrate how ratings are distributed across various mobile brands. 
This visualization helps in identifying which brands tend to garner higher or lower ratings from consumers.
